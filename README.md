# Tutorial Kubernetes

**About**

**Kubernetes Basics**

This tutorial provides a walkthrough of the basics of the **Kubernetes** cluster orchestration system. Each module contains some background information on major **Kubernetes** features and concepts, and includes an interactive online tutorial. These interactive tutorials let you manage a simple cluster and its containerized applications for yourself.

Using the interactive tutorials, you can learn to:

* Deploy a containerized application on a cluster.
* Scale the deployment.
* Update the containerized application with a new software version.
* Debug the containerized application.

The tutorials use [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com) to run a virtual terminal in your web browser that runs [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io), a small-scale local deployment of Kubernetes that can run anywhere. There's no need to install any software or configure anything; each interactive tutorial runs directly out of your web browser itself.
